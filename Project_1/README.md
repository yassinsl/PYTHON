## Cipher
    
## Description

This script provides functionalities for encoding and decoding messages using different cipher techniques. Ciphers play a crucial role in secure communication and cryptography. Users can explore and experiment with different ciphers to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

### Features

- **Substitution Cipher:** Replaces each letter in the message with another letter based on a substitution key.
- **Vigen√®re Cipher:** Uses a keyword to encrypt the message, providing a more complex form of substitution.

## Usage

1. Run the `CIPHER.py` script.
2. Select a cipher algorithm (Caesar, Substitution, Vigen√®re) when prompted.
3. Enter the message to be encrypted or decrypted.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide any additional required information (e.g., shift for Caesar Cipher, substitution key for Substitution Cipher, keyword for Vigen√®re Cipher).
5. View the result of the encryption or decryption.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Instructions

1. Navigate to the project directory:
