## Hangman

## Description

Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time. The game starts with a secret word that the player needs to uncover. With each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure is drawn. The player's goal is to guess the word before the hangman figure is completed.
## Features

- Randomly selects a word for the player to guess.
